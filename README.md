# Hi. I'm Nidia Gomez 

###  About Me:
I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at San Antonio with a strong interest in **Data Analytics**, **Product Insights**, and **Fashion Technology**.

I'm currently building data-driven projects that explore how consumer behavior, fashion trends, and transparency intersect. My passion project focuses on empowering fashion enthusiasts by using data to bring **fairness**, **clarity**, and **accessibility** to the fashion resale market.

💡 I’m especially interested in product analytics, A/B testing, trend forecasting, and building tools that turn raw data into real-world insights.
